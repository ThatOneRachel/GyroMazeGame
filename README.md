## Hi There! This is the GyroMazeGame
This is a small project for learning the SpriteKit framework for 2D game development. It uses the devices gyroscope to move a small ball and, when the ball reaches the ending, it starts over. 
The player has thirty seconds to reach the ending and the three smallest times get displayed in a ranking board. 
This project was based on https://github.com/brenici/gyrogame.
